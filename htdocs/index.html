            <strong>Renowned:</strong> The Morimoto Elite Systems have 
            earned their reputation amongst many as the aftermarket's best 
            set of HID's. We urge you to check out the specs below, read 
            the reviews and then ask yourself whether your ability to see 
            well while driving at night is worth saving a couple bucks?
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>HID Ballasts:</strong> Designed in California by 
            Morimoto’s engineer, Yoshi Ishida, the Morimoto XB 2.0 HID 
            Ballasts are just as good looking on the outside as they are 
            well-engineered on the inside. They are available in both 35w 
            and 50w versions, use proprietary software by the pros at 
            Hylux paired with packaging perfection from the masters at 
            Morimoto. This is today’s most modern iteration of a model 
            that has sold more than half a million units since inception, 
            and we don’t think it can really get any better!
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>HID Bulbs:</strong> At the heart of the XB D2S bulbs 
            is their perfectly aligned 100% Philips Quartz glass that 
            houses a capsule from APL-USA. Using high quality halide salts 
            from German-supplier Messer; the bulbs produce nearly the same 
            luminosity (intensity) as the amazing Osram CBI bulbs at 5500K. 
            No, you're not seeing things here, but yes you will be seeing 
            everything at night!
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Wiring:</strong> The Morimoto HD Relay Harness 
            features an all-new completely sealed double 40A Relays, 14 
            gauge stranded copper wire wrapped in durable black tech-flex 
            mesh that looks like a factory harness once installed. No 
            cutting or splicing here: there are only five connections and 
            they're all plug-n-play.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Canbus Compatible:</strong> The optional Standalone 
            Canbus harness substitute is recommended for European vehicles 
            that display "bulb out" error messsages. They contain a series 
            of capacitors and resistors to trick the car into thinking 
            nothing has changed and help you avoid annoying lamp-out 
            warnings on the dash.
        </p>
