                <p>
                    <strong>Renowned:</strong> The Morimoto Elite Systems have 
                    earned their reputation amongst many as the aftermarket's best 
                    set of HID's. We urge you to check out the specs below, read 
                    the reviews and then ask yourself whether your ability to see 
                    well while driving at night is worth saving a couple bucks?
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>HID Ballasts:</strong> Designed in California by 
                    Morimoto’s engineer, Yoshi Ishida, the Morimoto XB 2.0 HID 
                    Ballasts are just as good looking on the outside as they are 
                    well-engineered on the inside. They are available in both 35w 
                    and 50w versions, use proprietary software by the pros at 
                    Hylux paired with packaging perfection from the masters at 
                    Morimoto. This is today’s most modern iteration of a model 
                    that has sold more than half a million units since inception, 
                    and we don’t think it can really get any better!
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>HID Bulbs:</strong> At the heart of the XB D2S bulbs 
                    is their perfectly aligned 100% Philips Quartz glass that 
                    houses a capsule from APL-USA. Using high quality halide salts 
                    from German-supplier Messer; the bulbs produce nearly the same 
                    luminosity (intensity) as the amazing Osram CBI bulbs at 5500K. 
                    No, you're not seeing things here, but yes you will be seeing 
                    everything at night!
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Wiring:</strong> The Morimoto HD Relay Harness 
                    features an all-new completely sealed double 40A Relays, 14 
                    gauge stranded copper wire wrapped in durable black tech-flex 
                    mesh that looks like a factory harness once installed. No 
                    cutting or splicing here: there are only five connections and 
                    they're all plug-n-play.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Canbus Compatible:</strong> The optional Standalone 
                    Canbus harness substitute is recommended for European vehicles 
                    that display "bulb out" error messsages. They contain a series 
                    of capacitors and resistors to trick the car into thinking 
                    nothing has changed and help you avoid annoying lamp-out 
                    warnings on the dash.
